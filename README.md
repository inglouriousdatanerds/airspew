## Components

### Control Module
Has an exterior of sturdy, USA manufactured plastic.  The removable front panel has three control switches, described below.  External wiring connections exist for a photoresistor, leaflet dropper and audio output.  Within the control module are an Arduino UNO, an Adafruit Music Maker Sound Shield and an Adafruit FM radio transmitter.  A powerful 9V battery and a microSD card are replaceable components.

### Photoresistor

### Leaflet Dropper
Scaled down to handle index card sized leaflets, this component is made out of fragile balsa wood, plastic hinges, and superglue.  It also features rubberbands and bent paper clips.  Be careful with it; two hinges once fell off when Tim gave it a mean look. 

### Altec Speaker
A powerful, battery-operated waterproof speaker, it was selected primarily because the orange-red color was not selling well at Best Buy and I got a discount.  Please fully charge it before use.

### Landing Gear
This is a manifold of wire, originally designed for caging rabbits.  The edges covered with a duct tape, with a layer of paper towel beneath, are the surfaces on which the drone lands.

### Duct Tape
What project designed by veterans would be complete without a roll of duct tape?  This component is critical for attaching the photoresistor and making the rotor arm opaque to sunlight.

### Zip Ties
A ziploc bag of zipties is used to attach components to the DJI 4 Phantom.
