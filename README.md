## Components

### Control Module
Has an exterior of sturdy, USA manufactured plastic.  The removable front panel has three control switches, described below.  External wiring connections exist for a photoresistor, leaflet dropper and audio output.  Within the control module are an Arduino UNO, an Adafruit Music Maker Sound Shield and an Adafruit FM radio transmitter.  A powerful 9V battery and a microSD card are replaceable components.

### Photoresistor

### Leaflet Dropper
Scaled down to handle index card sized leaflets, this component is made out of fragile balsa wood, plastic hinges, and superglue.  It also features rubberbands and bent paper clips.  Be careful with it; two hinges once fell off when Tim gave it a mean look. Load leaflets by lifting the top lid, which is secured with Velcro (tm).

### Altec Speaker
A powerful, battery-operated waterproof speaker, it was selected primarily because the orange-red color was not selling well at Best Buy and I got a discount.  Please fully charge it before use.

### Landing Gear
This is a manifold of wire, originally designed for caging rabbits.  The edges covered with a duct tape, with a layer of paper towel beneath, are the surfaces on which the drone lands.

### Duct Tape
What project designed by veterans would be complete without a roll of duct tape?  This component is critical for attaching the photoresistor and making the rotor arm opaque to sunlight.

### Zip Ties
A ziploc bag of zipties is used to attach components to the DJI 4 Phantom.

## Installation
There is a video with installation instructions.  This text is to augment the video.  The drone is designed to carry either the speaker or the leaflet dropper.  One component must be removed before the adding the other.  The fm radio transmitter and wire antenna are permamently stored in the control module.

1. Landing Gear. 
Center drone landing skids on wire landing gear.  The landing gear should be oriented such that it entends port and starboard, **not** fore and aft.  Use 4 of the small red zip ties to secure the landing gear to the drone landing skids.

1. Speaker. 
Hold the power button on the speaker until it turn on.  There should be a recorded voice telling you "Powering On".  Press the + button multiple times for maximum output volume.  Attach the 3.5 mm audo jack to the speaker.  Center the speaker beneath the landing gear, so that the speaker is pointed downwards.  Use the two larger, clear zipties to secure the speaker.  Run one of the zipties through the speaker's carrying loop. 
1. Leaflet Dropper. 
**Load the leaflet dropper prior to installation!**  Installation will require some dexterity and finesse.  The dropper is held in place with bent paperclips, whihc in turn are held onto the dropper with rubberbands.  Note there are "studs" in the balsa wood to prevent rubberband slippage.  Center the lid of the leaflet dropper under the drone landing skids.  This placement increases the lift of the drone (decreases it the least actually).  Push the hooked paperclips up through the square holes in the rabbit fencing and position the hooks so the dropper hangs from them.
